# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-05)

**Core value:** 当用户注意力离开屏幕时，GlanceHold 能可靠、克制地替用户处理视频速度或播放状态，并在用户回来时恢复到合适状态，且不误恢复用户手动暂停的视频。
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — local camera, vision signal, calibration, and tuning

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: v1 is a vertical MVP with 5 coarse phases: menu-bar trust, pure policy, local Vision calibration, IINA control, and end-to-end hardening.
- [Roadmap]: Speed Control is the primary IINA mode; Pause/Resume remains secondary.
- [Roadmap]: SemiUHPE remains out of v1 implementation.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Vision threshold tuning and pose sign/orientation require empirical checks on the target Mac/camera setup.
- [Phase 4]: IINA control transport must be validated against sandbox behavior; mpv JSON IPC is the first candidate and an IINA plugin bridge is the fallback.
